6 Archetypes — copy (tagline + 2–3 sentences)



Hunter — “Momentum and pursuit.”
You’re driven by goals, progress, and the satisfaction of moving toward something. You energize plans, sharpen focus, and pull people into action. At your best, you create movement; at your worst, you can feel impatient with slow, vague, or overly emotional dynamics.



Bonder — “Connection and warmth.”
You build closeness through care, attention, and steady contact. You’re often the person who makes others feel seen and included. Your edge case is over-giving or staying too long in one-sided connections.



Competitor — “Edge and excellence.”
You bring intensity, standards, and a desire to level up. You like challenges, clear wins, and measurable improvement. In healthy fields you raise performance; in unhealthy ones you can feel like you’re carrying urgency alone.



Sage — “Clarity and sense-making.”
You’re oriented toward understanding: patterns, language, and insight. You help groups think better and decide cleaner. Your risk is being read as distant when people want comfort more than clarity.



FlowMaker — “Ease and play.”
You reduce friction and help social time feel natural. You bring timing, humor, and a sense of “this is working.” Your challenge is that you can be under-credited because what you do feels effortless to everyone else.



Anchor — “Stability and calm.”
You’re steady, grounded, and hard to rattle. You help groups feel safe and durable across time. Your edge case is being taken for granted, or staying too quiet when direction is needed.
