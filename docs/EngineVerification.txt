Engine Verification Checklist (MVP 0.8)

Normalization sanity
Confirm user vectors and all 16 type template vectors are normalized using the same method before distance comparison (no raw vs normalized mismatch).

Distance metric consistency
Verify the distance function (e.g., Euclidean) is applied consistently and deterministically, with no weighting drift across dimensions.

Rank scoring edge cases
Confirm behavior when users select fewer than the max options:
Unselected options contribute 0
Selected options receive correct diminishing rank points
No default values leak into scoring
Archetype tie handling
Define and implement a clear tie-break rule when top dimensions are equal or within a very small delta, to prevent flip-flopping.
Confidence calculation bounds
Ensure confidence is damped/capped (e.g., no extreme values unless the distance gap is clearly large) to avoid overclaiming precision.
